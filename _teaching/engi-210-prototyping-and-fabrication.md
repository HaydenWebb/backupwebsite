Led instruction, hosted workshops, and graded material for the Prototyping & Fabrication course for an undergraduate & graduate ENGI course of 60+ students.

## Description
Students in ENGI 210 will learn and practice advanced prototyping and fabrication skills useful in the construction of physical objects for engineering design projects. The course is structured as lecture and demonstration of basic and advanced prototyping techniques and out-of-class work practicing and honing the application of these techniques. Example techniques include low fidelity prototyping, 2D and 3D Computer Aided Design, electronics, foam cutting, laser cutting, plasma cutting, 3D printing, and molding/casting methods. Students will individually apply these techniques to create physical objects.
