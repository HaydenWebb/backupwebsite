### Description
Mechanics is the branch of the physical sciences that deals with the response of bodies to the action of forces and is based on the implementation of Newton’s laws. Statics is the study of bodies in equilibrium and is based on Newton’s first and third laws, while Dynamics focuses on bodies in motion and is based on Newton’s second and third laws. This class focuses on Rigid Body Dynamics.
