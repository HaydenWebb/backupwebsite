## Abstract
In-hand manipulation is a crucial ability for reorienting and repositioning objects within grasps. The main challenges are not only the complexity in the computational models, but also the risks of grasp instability caused by active finger motions, such as rolling, sliding, breaking, and remaking contacts. Based on the idea of manipulation without lifting a finger, this paper presents the development of Roller Rings (RR), a modular robotic attachment with active surfaces that is wearable by both robot and human hands. By installing and angling the RRs on grasping systems, such that their spatial motions are not co-linear, we derive a general differential motion model for the object actuated by the active surfaces. Our motion model shows that complete in-hand manipulation skill sets can be provided by as few as only $2$ RRs through non-holonomic object motions, while more RRs can enable enhanced manipulation dexterity with fewer motion constraints. Through extensive experiments, we wear RRs on both a robot hand and a human hand to evaluate their manipulation capabilities, and show that the RRs can be employed to manipulate arbitrary object shapes to provide dexterous in-hand manipulation. By mirroring the RR along its vertical axis, a mirrored axis can be created from the reflected angled CASM. Grasping an object with the original and mirrored RR creates two unique, oblique planes that the active surface travels through to manipulate in a 3D space. This combination of activated surface and angled CASM generates a new method of fast IHM that allows for non-holonomic differential motions, which together compose a complete solution for non-holonomic in-hand manipulation. This idea can be further extrapolated so that any sum of RR's can be used by a robotic system and add IHM capabilities. From this concept, we have developed the first general formulation of a motion model for active surface-based IHM. The RR was tested for its manipulation capabilities on objects of varying geometries and sizes on both robot and human hands, and it displayed efficient IHM capabilities for both applications.
