I am an undergraduate student at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/) studying Mechanical Engineering (Minor in Engineering Design), where I am a Robotics Research Assistant in the [RobotPi Lab](https://robotpilab.github.io/). I am broadly interested in bio-mimetic robotics, integrable technology, and control systems that can be utilized to physically manipulate the world around us, and I explore these various topics in my [research](https://webbhayden.com/portfolio/). Currently, I am working on developing & designing new forms of robotic in-hand manipulator systems in order to further the gripping and manipulating capabilities of current robot hands.

Additionally, I work for both the [Rice University Mechanical Engineering Department](https://mech.rice.edu/) and [Rice University Oshman Engineering Design Kitchen](https://oedk.rice.edu/) as a Teaching Assistant to further promote and teach Engineering in the Rice undergraduate & graduate community.
