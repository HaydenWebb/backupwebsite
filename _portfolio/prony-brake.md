### Description
Prony Brakes are a mechanical tool for determining the torque of a system's motor and nominally consist of a friction brake with weight to generate a counter torque to a motor. This device goes beyond this by implementing a Load Cell with amplification for identifying the dynamic torque, as well as integrating a photo sensor for recording the given motor's speed. Using this combination, and a given Arduino IDE, students using this device can experimentally determine the power of a motor. Several of these devices were generated with documentation so that future students and TA's for an upper level MECH course can modify, paramterize, and expand the device further for future needs.

### Personal Contribution
Designed and developed multiple functional 3D-Printed Prony Brakes to mechanically test the concepts of dynamic torque, speed, and power through inset motors and load cells. Built an electronic subsystem consisting of a photo interrupter, Arduino microcontroller, and signal amplifier to calculate the torque and RPM of a motor for use in an upper level MECH course.
