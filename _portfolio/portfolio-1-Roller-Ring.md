## Description
The Roller Ring is a robotic attachment composed of rotating activated surfaces. The attachment, when affixed to a robot or human hand, allows for non-holonomic manipulation through the traversing of differential manipulation vectors. The device consists of an actuated timing belt on a roller system as well as a soft insert. The belt is controlled by a back-mounted geared power system to allow for low displacement between the activated surface and robot hand surface. The soft insert is a removable inverted quatrefoil with gaps in the inner diameter to allow for deformation and hold objects of non-standard geometry to be secured within the device. These systems implemented together allow for a versatile attachment device that can affix to a myriad of varying systems, generates differential manipulation, and allows for dexterous manipulation whilst maintaining stability.

## Personal Contribution
Developed the mechanical design of the Roller Ring as well as the manipulation algorithms to create a device capable of optimally manipulating objects in 3D space when affixed to both robot & human grasping systems. Code base & robot hand for the test environment came from the Yale Grab Hand Lab and was further modified to accommodate the Roller Ring components.
